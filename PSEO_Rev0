        I don't want to be out to far. It also has a good CS program.
        If you read their website, a lot of people enjoy and think
        that their CS program teaches you well and is enjoyable.</td>

        that I would do while I'm in college on the days I don't have
        class. I am interested because my family members work there
        and I feel like it would be a good hands on work experience
        to improve my CS skills. I would also like to continue
        working their after college and make it my full time

        <td>I would like to check out UE because it's close and my dad
        used to go there. As well as a good CS program. Most of all my reasons
        to wanting to go to a college is because it's either close or has a good
        CS program. It's also nice to go somewhere that your family member has gone
        to because it gives you someone with experience with the college your going to.</td>

        <td>Why I put Indiana University in Bloomington on here is because
            I visited IU for a football game and I got to go inside the Luddy
            building and I'm not making this up when I say this, it was the
            coolest CS building I have ever seen. I almost choose IU just
            because I was in love with the building. But I decided I would
            check out other options because IU contains a lot of people.
            Still a really good school with a good CS program though.</td>

        <td>Ivy Tech would not be my first choice, but it is good to go to
            if you would like to improve your CS skills. You can also take
            your classes online and stay at home which is nice if you would
            like to do college at home. I still would rather have visual learning
            and watch the teacher explain things, so this would not be my first
            choice. Still a good college though, it has a lot of options.
