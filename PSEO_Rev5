        to wanting to go to a college is because it's either close or has a good
        CS program. It's also nice to go somewhere that your family member has gone
        to because it gives you someone with experience with the college your going to.</p></td>

            building and I'm not making this up when I say this, it was the
            coolest CS building I have ever seen. I almost choose IU just
            because I was in love with the building. But I decided I would
            check out other options because IU contains a lot of people.
            Still a really good school with a good CS program though.</p></td>

            your classes online and stay at home which is nice if you would
            like to do college at home. I still would rather have visual learning
            and watch the teacher explain things, so this would not be my first
            choice. Still a good college though, it has a lot of options.</p></td>

            I have always wanted to go here but it's around 3 hours away which isnt bad.
            But it's also a really big school with a lot of people. They have a bunch of
            courses involving computer science but you also need languages in highschool
            which I didn't do. But who knows, miracles can happen. I love how many

            So I will still check it out, they also allow online computer science
            classes. The curriculum provides flexibility for working professionals.
