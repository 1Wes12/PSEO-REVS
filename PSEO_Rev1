<!--Make sure to add new indents in the school names to make them line up in the middle-->
<!--Line the number, school name, description, and image up to indent in the middle-->
<!--Honestly just use the center marking code so it lines up in the middle it will be easier that way-->
<!--Also line up the Title thats at the very top to the center-->

        and I feel like it would be a good hands on work experience

        used to go there. As well as a good CS program. Most of all my reasons
        to wanting to go to a college is because it's either close or has a good
        CS program. It's also nice to go somewhere that your family member has gone
        to because it gives you someone with experience with the college your going to.</td>

            I visited IU for a football game and I got to go inside the Luddy
            building and I'm not making this up when I say this, it was the
            coolest CS building I have ever seen. I almost choose IU just
            because I was in love with the building. But I decided I would
            check out other options because IU contains a lot of people.
            Still a really good school with a good CS program though.</td>

            if you would like to improve your CS skills. You can also take
            your classes online and stay at home which is nice if you would
            like to do college at home. I still would rather have visual learning
            and watch the teacher explain things, so this would not be my first
            choice. Still a good college though, it has a lot of options.

            amount. They cover over 4 technologies. There are a lot of key learning outcomes and they have good
            teaching and help you understand well. This would be a good school for me to go to pursue computer
            science. It is only 30 minutes away from where I am located to, so I will definently keep this 
            college in mind.</td>

            But it's also a really big school with a lot of people. They have a bunch of
            courses involving computer science but you also need languages in highschool
            which I didn't do. But who knows, miracles can happen. I love how many
            computer science related options they have for the students at this school.</td>

            consider it because they have 5 computer science related courses.
            So I will still check it out, they also allow online computer science
            classes. The curriculum provides flexibility for working professionals.
            Not one of my top colleges I want to go to but I will still check it out.</td>
